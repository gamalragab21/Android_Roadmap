## :cyclone: What about android as operating system(OS):

Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software.   
**Designed for:**

`First of all we should learn a programming language from [java or Kotlin] and XML [for building the user interface(UI)]`

## I recommend you to start with java as a programming language.. why? :sweat_smile:

- In my opinion most of apps built with java and if you worked somewhere at a company , how do you refactor or add new features to this app that built with java!
- Most of open source was written with java.
- There are much more Java tutorials and almost every solution for Android problems on pages like Stack Overflow from the last years have been written in Java. 
- Understanding the syntax of a language is one thing, but to actually build apps you have to learn how to use the different framework and library APIs. You have to learn what classes you have to use and which methods you have to call in the different phases of your app. And for this you need practice and a lot of examples you can refer to.
